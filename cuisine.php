<h2 id="sectionTitle">Cuisine</h2>

<p id="sectionContent">Izmir's cuisine has largely been affected by its multicultural history. Therefore, the large
    variety of food originating from the Aegean and Mediterranean regions. Population movement from Eastern and South
    East Anatolia regions has enriched the local cuisine. Another factor is the large and fertile area of land
    surrounding the region which grows a rich selection of vegetables. Boyoz, Kumru and Lokma are associated with Izmir
    cuisine.</p>
